# MotionDetectionTask
This task is used to test memory and perceptual illusions.

ABSTRACT
Our experience of the world is shaped by expectations. If something happens a lot, a bias towards that thing happening forms. This can alter the report of an experience if the expectations are not lived up to. However, it is unclear if this altered report is the perception of the experience itself, or the effect of a small delay creating an illusionary memory at the recall. In this research, participants see moving dots and have to determine their direction of movement. An expectation is created with a bias towards an 32° angle. Sometimes, no dots were present, but participants answered confidently nevertheless. These trials are the illusionary reports. Here we show that the patterns in illusionary reports follow the same pattern as the valid reports, with dots present. A delay variable was added to compare perceptual and memory illusions. An interesting finding is the significant difference between answers around 35° and 45° in the barely visible dots. There seems to be an already existing bias towards 45°, overruling our induced bias of 32°. Any diagonal line might be interpreted with a bias towards the ‘ultimate diagonal’ of 45°.
